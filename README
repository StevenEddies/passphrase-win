Passphrase Generator


A simple program that generates random passphrases as a secure alternative to other types of password. Inspired by the likes of Diceware and XKCD's famous “correct horse battery staple” comic, the idea is that phrases are easier to remember than complicated strings of characters. Humans tend to choose easily guessed phrases, but by generating them randomly, this tendency is removed.
