    <h1>Help</h1>
    <p>First, select a dictionary with the slider. Larger dictionaries will make more secure passphrases, but some of the words might be obscure and harder to remember.</p>
    <p>Next, select the number of words in the phrase. Similarly, using more words will make a more secure passphrase, but it will be harder to remember.</p>
    <p>You'll see the strength of those settings below, measured in bits. Each extra bit means it takes twice as many attempts to guess your phrase. The strength you need varies depending on how secure you want things to be, and who you ask.</p>
    <p>Then click Generate on the toolbar to generate a passphrase with your chosen settings. That's all there is to it; simply start using your passphrase! If you need another, press the Generate button again.</p>
    <p>If you really dislike the generated passphrase, you can press the Generate button to generate another. However, don't keep doing this repeatedly as this reduces the randomness of the final phrase and lowers its security.</p>
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>How do I know this program is trustworthy?</strong></p>
    <p>The short answer is, you don't know for definite; there are some decisions that you have to make yourself. However, it is open source, so you're welcome to look through the source code if that helps.</p>
    <p>For the truly paranoid, I'd recommend <a href="http://diceware.com/">Diceware</a>. It uses physical dice and a paper word list so you don't have to trust anyone.</p>
    <p><strong>Are the passphrases truly random?</strong></p>
    <p>No, but they use a cryptographically secure generator, so it's about as close as you can get.</p>
    <p><strong>What about dictionary attacks?</strong></p>
    <p>Some people claim that passphrases are vulnerable to dictionary attacks. It's true that a dictionary attack is the fastest way to crack a passphrase - but all of the calculations for entropy / strength already take dictionary attacks into account. That's the whole point!</p>
    <p><strong>How large are the dictionaries?</strong></p>
    <p>The tiny dictionary is about 730 words (depending on your language), and each larger dictionary approximately doubles that, up to about 80,000 for the extreme dictionary.</p>

    <h1>Security Tips</h1>
    <p>Follow all the usual advice for passwords in general:</p>
    <p>Never tell anyone. If you write it down, make sure it's kept safe. Never store it on your computer except in a dedicated password manager. Don't use the same one for several sites.</p>
    <h2>Randomness</h2>
    <p>The most important thing to know about passphrases in particular is they only work when they are random.</p>
    <p>Human beings are really bad at being random. If you try to think of a passphrase yourself, it may seem random to you, but the chances are that it could be easily guessed. That's why we use computers (or <a href="http://diceware.com/">dice</a>) to do it for us.</p>
    <p>Along similar lines, if you dislike a particular passphrase or find it difficult to remember, I'd recommend generating another one. But don't keep doing that repeatedly as it reduces the randomness.</p>
    <h2>Memorising</h2>
    <p>If you can't remember your password instantly, write it down on a piece of paper and <em>keep it in a safe place</em>. Every few hours, try to remember it, then check. When you're confident you've got it, burn or shred the paper.</p>
    <p>If you're using strong encryption, <em>don't forget your passphrase</em>, whatever happens. Your encrypted data will be completely lost.</p>
    <h2>Password Managers</h2>
    <p>Passphrases work well combined with password managers. A good strong passphrase can be used as the master password for the password manager, and then the password manager can be used to generate gibberish passwords for each account.</p>

        <p>The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist with Frequency Classification".</p>

            <blockquote><p>I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to be lacking any copyright notice.</p></blockquote>
            <p>There were many many sources in total, but any text marked "copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public domain.</p>
            <p>Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100</p>
            <blockquote><p>So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?</p></blockquote>
            <p>That is the intention.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.</p>
        <p>The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via my inflection database.</p>

        <p>The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the public domain.</p>
        <p>The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words words appearing in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12 dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in other word lists is included.</p>
        <p>The name files form the Census report is a government document which I don't think can be copyrighted.</p>
        <p>The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the "Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon File". All of which is in the Public Domain. This file also contains a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the special/ directory.</p>
        <p>The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version 4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also in the public domain.</p>
        <p>The 60 level includes all words appearing in at least 2 of the 12 dictionaries as indicated by the 12Dicts package.</p>
        <p>The 70 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and the 74,550 common dictionary words from the MWords package.  The common dictionary words, like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of the 12Dics package which is the public domain.</p>
        <p>The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary" (UKACD), the list of signature words in from YAWL package, and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.</p>
